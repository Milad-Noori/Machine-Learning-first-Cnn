This repository contains my very first attempt at building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
I’ve just written around ten lines of code so far, but it marks the beginning of my deep learning journey.
The purpose of this project is simply to experiment, learn, and understand the core concepts of CNNs.
I plan to gradually expand this project as I become more comfortable with neural network architectures.
For now, the code includes the basic structure needed to initialize a simple model.
More updates will be added soon as I work step-by-step through the implementation.
This project is not meant to be perfect—it's meant to help me learn.
If you’re reading this, feel free to follow the progress as it evolves over time
